## What I think I want to do

I've been researching a bit in Graphics programming for the past couple of days and I think that's what I want to specialize in. It's got everything I really wanted in a specialization; computer science (obviously), maths, bits of creativity and hopefully some cool looking stuff at the end. I always felt a little unguided in my pursuit of becoming a programmer, as in, what do I want to do when I grow up? How will this all translate into a job? What actual programming **role** to I want to be doing? boring stuff like that. Everyone talking about AI these days, it doesn't intrigue me. Graphics intrigues me. I feel like I've always wanted to do something in the region of it but my lack of drive pulled me away. I'm going to try and see if this is what I want to do in my forever. Learning and tutorials and all that right now. I had that little twang of "I know what I want to be doing" in my head when I made a conscious decision to start thinking about graphics further than just a speck of cs that I don't take notice to. Something I could work towards. I never really had that with other fields in cs. I have it with music. It's what I assume pilots and authors felt when they were a child, encouraging them to steer their life in the direction of a goal. This may be my goal. I look forward to seeing further.
