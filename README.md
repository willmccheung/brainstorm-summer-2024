# brainstorm-summer-2024
Currently gonna just be a repo for ideas of projects I may wanna do

---

## Ideas

- Find an OS project you want to contribute to

- Look for problems in your life that need solutions

- Think of a game you would want to play that doesn't exist

- Find a coding buddy (Discord works for this best)

- Grind through coding katas (look up what this is)

- Look for small jobs to do online (probably not viable but could still look)

- Find a hack-a-thon to participate in

- Start accumulating a list of do-ers to get inspired by their projects

- Clone another app or service just to learn how

- Start a project to learn a skill outside of programming like DevOps, design, tech writing, cloud services, etc...(these skills will help your career)

- Start with your interests and hobbies, so if you can build a database around the things you love, and an interface to those things that would make you love those things even more.

- a doodle/screenshot/image manipulation tool based on computer vision algorithms. E.g.
	image resizing? Seam carving!
	automatic window detection for cropping
	pen that stops at one side of a line due to the power of edge detection
	etc.

- a sound generator for alien noises

- some whacky window manager with completely unprecedented elements
